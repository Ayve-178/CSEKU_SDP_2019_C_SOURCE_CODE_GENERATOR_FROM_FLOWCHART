Project Desciption : We made an application that will generate C source code from flowchart. It will generate code for "declaration","initialization","scanf","printf","condition" and "for loop". We can generate any type of flowchart and the software will give us the source code in C. We can edit in flowchart if any mistake is done. If we save the source code it wil save with '.c' extension and it can be compiled and run in CodeBlocks and give us the output. The sourch code and the whole project link is given here.
